                <p> Some innovations are so simple that you wonder why they weren’t thought of before.<span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1"> A lot of these innovations have some pretty wild stories behind their creation, and some of them end up having a completely different use than what they were originally planned for.
                    You might believe, you at least have a rough idea of where your everyday items come from, but then when you look at the history books, things get weird. Keep in mind, there is lot more than what meets the eyes. High heels, webcam, treadmill, all these usual households have a not-so-usual origin story.</span></p>

                <h3>Is Twitter setting dusk under Elon Musk?|TechCast</h3>
                <p>“If you listen to my sins, I would sound like the worst person on the Earth”<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">  this is how Mr.Musk described himself in a recent TED talk.While many of us might be amazed by the leadership and innovation of Elon Musk at SpaceX and Tesla, the same cannot be said about his recent takeover of Twitter.
                    In a recent poll by the Twitter chief, 57.5% of users voted in favor of his resignation. Though this result was not shocking as there had been a deep stated hatred against Musk from the time he announced the takeover of the company. A man who came in with the promises of “Power to people” and “Free speech” is now the reason for many users quitting Twitter.
                    
                    Tune in to our latest episode of TechCast to know about the Twitter takeover saga and the quirky decisions that led the 44 Billion Dollar deal to backfire and topsy turvy Twitter.</span></p>
